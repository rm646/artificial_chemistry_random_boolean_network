## Introduction

I wrote this in the summer of 2013 while exploring how to add an analogue of
geometry to an artificial chemistry based on random boolean networks
(see slides.pdf), working under Prof. Susan Stepney and Dr. Angelika
Sebald.

When I wrote this, I also made some diagrams showing the code
flow for various scripts, which I've uploaded. Unfortunately I don't have a
MATLAB license any more so I haven't tested any of this code recently.

I'm uploading it now as evidence of MATLAB experience, and also for any
interested parties: I thought it was an intriguing idea at the time, and
Prof. Susan Stepney and Dr. Angelika Sebald are still actively researching
the area as far as I'm aware.
